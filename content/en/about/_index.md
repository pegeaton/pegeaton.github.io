My goal is to provide articles on a variety of topics, some educational and some entertaining.

The writing course that motivated this website covered the history of technical writing and the general mechanics but the build out of content was done in a rather old-fashion serial manner. The process was not agile and that is critical for writers today. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (think publishing) are quite difficult given a pipeline to production using only basic tools.  

I set out to create a blog for the Modern Apps Ninja community on using GitHub Actions in the repository. In the end, I realized to post even one more update to the blog I MUST automate the process! For the blog, I use the tools Art Fewell uses to administer and support the modernapps.ninja site (GitHub, GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions, Hugo, Docsy).  More details on the tools in the blog series.   

I hope you enjoy the blog and find it helpful.
